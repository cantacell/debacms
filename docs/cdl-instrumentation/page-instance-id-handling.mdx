## Page/previous page instance id
Page/previous page instance id  is used to track pages which user visited including different domain pages.
To track user navigation it will listen for clicks on link elements and attach pixall query parameter to the final link href
(so all link navigations on website will be modified) to retrieve that value from URL on next page.
