### Signal Page is Ready

By default, the cdl starts to process the data layer (`coxAutoDataLayer`) just after the library is downloaded.

Some pages don't have all the data necessary right at load and that is where setting `dataLayerReady` to `false` comes in handy.

:::info
It is possible set to `false` only before the library is loaded.
:::

```js title='Example:'
coxAutoDataLayer.push({
  ...,
  dataLayerReady: false
});
```

#### Manually set to true

If `dataLayerReady` was previously set to `false`, in order to set it to `true` it is required to make a data layer push that contains the `dataLayerReady` property

```js title='Example:'
coxAutoDataLayer.push({
  ...,
  dataLayerReady: true
});
```
