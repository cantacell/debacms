### Send a Page View event

Here is how you manually fire a page-view event:

```js title='Example:'
coxAutoDataLayer.push({
  eventProperties: {
    action : 'view',
    element: 'page'
  }
});
```

By default, we will **not** automatically fire the first page view event.
If you want that the first page-view event to be fired automatically, here is how you can opt in:

```js title='Example:'
coxAutoDataLayer.push({
  autoFirstPageView: true
});
```

:::info
It is possible to set `autoFirstPageView` to `true` only before the library is loaded.
