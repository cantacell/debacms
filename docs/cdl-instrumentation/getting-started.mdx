If you are already loading pixall library, you don't have to change anything about initializing pixall. Continue to just loading it as you today.

Else if you don't already load pixall, [**talk to us**](mailto:michelle.westbay@coxautoinc.com).

## Instrumentation option 1, pushing into coxAutoDataLayer object

Add the following code at the top of the web page.

```js title='Example:'
window.coxAutoDataLayer = window.coxAutoDataLayer || [];
```

### Add data into data layer

To add data into data layer simply use the `push` method of the `coxAutoDataLayer`.

```js title='Example:'
coxAutoDataLayer.push(
  {
    myData: 'myValue'
  }
);
```

:::note
There are 2 types of pushes:

- push that include event metadata
- push that doesn't include event metadata

They are equivalent to each other except that the first one has a different behavior as described in this

- <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>TODO:</span> add the mandatory fields.

```js title='Example:'
coxAutoDataLayer.push({
  'application': {
    'componentId': '123456',
    'version': '1.0',
    'isProduction': false
  }
});
```
